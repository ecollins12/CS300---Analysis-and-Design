# CS300---Analysis-and-Design


The main learning objectives for this course were learning about different data structures, how to manipulate them, and how to apply them in programming.
I think it's really important to learn about each data structure because they all have different advantages and each can be more beneficial than the other depending on the problem you will be trying to solve. I approached each problem by gaining an understanding of how each type of data structure can be used to solve a data-related problem, and then using that knowledge to hopefully apply the correct one. 
Within my coding experience so far I’ve had some frustrating roadblocks where I know the logic of what I’m try to do to solve a problem, but I struggle to translate that to code. I typically will solve these roadblocks by retracing my steps and learning from the ZyBooks readings or going online to stack overflow or something similar and looking for help there. 
I think data manipulation is incredibly important so having a stronger understanding of that will help me endless in my programming career. 
I think throughout the Computer Science degree I have been getting progressively better at apply object-oriented principals to my code. Especially in the projects in this course where you have to call different functions to manipulate data, I have gotten better and better at modulating code. It’s especially satisfying when I can call the same function in different areas to have its functionality solve different problems.
